Defaults to ImitateBrowserBehavior\n *                    when the DOM is available, null otherwise\n * - onError          A function that is used to handle errors\n * - onAbort          A function that is used to handle aborted transitions\n *\n * When rendering in a server-side environment, the location should simply\n * be the URL path that was used in the request, including the query string.\n */\nfunction createRouter(options) {\n  options = options || {};\n\n  if (isReactChildren(options)) options = { routes: options };\n\n  var mountedComponents = [];\n  var location = options.location || DEFAULT_LOCATION;\n  var scrollBehavior = options.scrollBehavior || DEFAULT_SCROLL_BEHAVIOR;\n  var state = {};\n  var nextState = {};\n  var pendingTransition = null;\n  var dispatchHandler = null;\n\n  if (typeof location === 'string') location = new StaticLocation(location);\n\n  if (location instanceof StaticLocation) {\n    warning(!canUseDOM || process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test', 'You should not use a static location in a DOM environment because ' + 'the router will not be kept in sync with the current URL');\n  } else {\n    invariant(canUseDOM || location.needsDOM === false, 'You cannot use %s without a DOM', location);\n  }\n\n  // Automatically fall back to full page refreshes in\n  // browsers that don't support the HTML history API.\n  if (location === HistoryLocation && !supportsHistory()) location = RefreshLocation;\n\n  var Router = React.createClass({\n\n    displayName: 'Router',\n\n    statics: {\n\n      isRunning: false,\n\n      cancelPendingTransition: function cancelPendingTransition() {\n        if (pendingTransition) {\n          pendingTransition.cancel();\n          pendingTransition = null;\n        }\n      },\n\n      clearAllRoutes: function clearAllRoutes() {\n        Router.cancelPendingTransition();\n        Router.namedRoutes = {};\n        Router.routes = [];\n      },\n\n      /**\n       * Adds routes to this router from the given children object (see ReactChildren).\n       */\n      addRoutes: function addRoutes(routes) {\n        if (isReactChildren(routes)) routes = createRoutesFromReactChildren(routes);\n\n        addRoutesToNamedRoutes(routes, Router.namedRoutes);\n\n        Router.routes.push.apply(Router.routes, routes);\n      },\n\n      /**\n       * Replaces routes of this router from the given children object (see ReactChildren).\n       */\n      replaceRoutes: function replaceRoutes(routes) {\n        Router.clearAllRoutes();\n        Router.addRoutes(routes);\n        Router.refresh();\n      },\n\n      /**\n       * Performs a match of the given path against this router and returns an object\n       * with the { routes, params, pathname, query } that match.

This is\n * different from generic pub-sub systems in two ways:\n *\n *   1) Callbacks are not subscribed to particular events. Every payload is\n *      dispatched to every registered callback.\n *   2) Callbacks can be deferred in whole or part until other callbacks have\n *      been executed.\n *\n * For example, consider this hypothetical flight destination form, which\n * selects a default city when a country is selected:\n *\n *   var flightDispatcher = new Dispatcher();\n *\n *   // Keeps track of which country is selected\n *   var CountryStore = {country: null};\n *\n *   // Keeps track of which city is selected\n *   var CityStore = {city: null};\n *\n *   // Keeps track of the base flight price of the selected city\n *   var FlightPriceStore = {price: null}\n *\n * When a user changes the selected city, we dispatch the payload:\n *\n *   flightDispatcher.dispatch({\n *     actionType: 'city-update',\n *     selectedCity: 'paris'\n *   });\n *\n * This payload is digested by `CityStore`:\n *\n *   flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *     if (payload.actionType === 'city-update') {\n *       CityStore.city = payload.selectedCity;\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * When the user selects a country, we dispatch the payload:\n *\n *   flightDispatcher.dispatch({\n *     actionType: 'country-update',\n *     selectedCountry: 'australia'\n *   });\n *\n * This payload is digested by both stores:\n *\n *    CountryStore.dispatchToken = flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *     if (payload.actionType === 'country-update') {\n *       CountryStore.country = payload.selectedCountry;\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * When the callback to update `CountryStore` is registered, we save a reference\n * to the returned token. Using this token with `waitFor()`, we can guarantee\n * that `CountryStore` is updated before the callback that updates `CityStore`\n * needs to query its data.\n *\n *   CityStore.dispatchToken = flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *     if (payload.actionType === 'country-update') {\n *       // `CountryStore.country` may not be updated.\n *       flightDispatcher.waitFor([CountryStore.dispatchToken]);\n *       // `CountryStore.country` is now guaranteed to be updated.\n *\n *       // Select the default city for the new country\n *       CityStore.city = getDefaultCityForCountry(CountryStore.country);\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * The usage of `waitFor()` can be chained, for example:\n *\n *   FlightPriceStore.dispatchToken =\n *     flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *       switch (payload.actionType) {\n *         case 'country-update':\n *           flightDispatcher.waitFor([CityStore.dispatchToken]);\n *           FlightPriceStore.price =\n *             getFlightPriceStore(CountryStore.country, CityStore.city);\n *           break;\n *\n *         case 'city-update':\n *           FlightPriceStore.price =\n *             FlightPriceStore(CountryStore.country, CityStore.city);\n *           break;\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * The `country-update` payload will be guaranteed to invoke the stores'\n * registered callbacks in order: `CountryStore`, `CityStore`, then\n * `FlightPriceStore`.\n */\n\n  function Dispatcher() {\n    this.$Dispatcher_callbacks = {};\n    this.$Dispatcher_isPending = {};\n    this.$Dispatcher_isHandled = {};\n    this.$Dispatcher_isDispatching = false;\n    this.$Dispatcher_pendingPayload = null;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Registers a callback to be invoked with every dispatched payload.
